# OneBusAway Sign Mode Prototype

This is a modern, SvelteKit-based prototype for the **Next Generation Sign Mode** project proposed for Google Summer of Code with the [Open Transit Software Foundation](https://github.com/OneBusAway). It is designed to display real-time transit arrival information in a clean, full-screen interface for use on public displays such as kiosks, TVs, and station monitors.

It replicates and improves upon the legacy Sign Mode functionality from the original OneBusAway web application, offering a more modern tech stack, better configurability, and enhanced UI/UX.

## ‚ú® Features

- Display real-time arrival data for one or more stop IDs
- Configurable via URL parameters (no UI required)
- Auto-refreshes at user-defined intervals
- Grouped by route and destination
- Emphasized display of the next arriving bus
- Responsive layout with a modern design (Tailwind CSS)
- Designed for deployment to kiosk screens, TVs, or digital signage

## üñº Example

This is a live view generated by the prototype using real-time data from OneBusAway.

![Sign Mode Demo](./demo.png)

Visit a running version with a demo stop ID:

http://localhost:5173/?stopIds=1_75403&title=University%20Way&refresh=20

Displays all upcoming buses at stop `1_75403`, with a custom title and a refresh interval of 20 seconds.
